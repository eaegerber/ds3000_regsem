To ensure that your submitted `ipynb` file represents your latest code, make sure to give a fresh `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the `ipynb` file to gradescope.\n\n### Tips for success\n- Start early\n- Make use of Piazza (also accessible through Canvas)\n- Make use of Office Hours\n- Remember to use cells and headings to make the notebook easy to read (if a grader cannot find the answer to a problem, you will receive no points for it)\n- Under no circumstances may one student view or share their ungraded homework or quiz with another student [(see also)](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity), though you are welcome to **talk about** (*not* show each other your answers to) the problems."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "# Part 1 (25 points): Markdown in Jupyter\n\nUse the markdown language below to create your own brief wikipedia-esque description of any subject of interest. \n\nYour mini-wiki page must include:\n- three headers: a title, subtitle and subsubtitle (the #, ##, ### syntax)\n- an embedded image from a web address (use an [image hosting site](https://makeawebsitehub.com/free-photo-hosting/) if you'd like to upload your own)\n- a table of size at least 3 rows x 3 columns (needn't be correct, but must make sense)\n- a list\n- a link to another website\n\nPlease be brief in your text.  Aim for roughly 3 sentences total of text.  We won't grade based on content, but keep it appropriate for class.
