    "- Remember to use cells and headings to make the notebook easy to read (if a grader cannot find the answer to a problem, you will receive no points for it)\n",
    "- Under no circumstances may one student view or share their ungraded homework or quiz with another student [(see also)](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity), though you are welcome to **talk about** (not show each other) the problems."
