    "Submit this `ipynb` file to Gradescope ([1:35 Section](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/431947) [3:25 Section](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/431864)) (this can also be done via the assignment on Canvas).  To ensure that your submitted `ipynb` file represents your latest code, make sure to give a fresh `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the `ipynb` file to gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for success\n",
    "- Start early\n",
    "- Make use of Piazza ([1:35 Section](https://piazza.com/class/l7dkfe3cgz21ul) [3:25 Section](https://piazza.com/class/l7dkey4g6m71e5)) (also accessable through Canvas)\n",
    "- Make use of [Office Hours](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SMacPh9lhRvjHI1VCJfBbNGSga3RTYKzSsfRWEWqWQI/edit?usp=sharing)\n",
    "- Remember to use cells and headings to make the notebook easy to read (if a grader cannot find the answer to a problem, you will receive no points for it)\n",
    "    - Remember that documentation/style is important (See the Style Guide on Canvas!)\n",
    "- Under no circumstances may one student view or share their ungraded homework or quiz with another student [(see also)](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity), though you are welcome to **talk about** (not show each other) the problems."
