To ensure that your submitted `ipynb` file represents your latest code, make sure to give a fresh `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the `ipynb` file to gradescope. **In addition:**\n- \"Sign\" the academic integrity pledge above with your name\n- Make sure you comment your code effectively\n- If problems are difficult for the TAs/Profs to grade, you will lose points\n\n### Note: This is an **EXAM**\nWhile I encourage some dialogue (*never* sharing of answers) on most assignments, this is an **EXAM**.
