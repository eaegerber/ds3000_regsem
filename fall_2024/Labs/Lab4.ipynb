    "Can you use other numeric features of a song to predict which mode (Major or Minor) the song is in? To simplify the problem, and visualize it, we will narrow our set of $x$ features to consist of ($x_1$: energy, $x_2$: key, and $x_3$: loudness). On the Getting to Know You survey from the first week of class, many of you put your favorite song. These have been collected in a Spotify playlist ([link here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3lDbfa8bVjjcpJtFIoHBv2?si=bc1a57aa591742cd&nd=1&dlsi=b555927ecc744549)). Spotify also allows you to download detailed information about songs in playlists. Dr. Gerber has done this for you, **scaled the data**, and stored them in his github. Run the first code cell below to read it into this jupyter notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the plot, can you say if there is a 2D plane that will perfectly separate the Major (1) from the Minor (-1) mode songs? Do you think it would still be helpful to create a perceptron decision boundary to help predict if a song is in major or minor mode with these data?\n",
