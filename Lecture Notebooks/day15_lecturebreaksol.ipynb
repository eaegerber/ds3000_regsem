Not only do we have (see below) very high accuracy (overall correct prediction proportion) and sensitivity (true positive rate: the proportion of correctly predicted matches) we also have a perfect sensitivity (we have no false positives; everyone we predict wouldn't go on a date, didn't). Keep in mind, however, that since this is a **random** forest, we may not get the exact same results every time we run it, but as long as the results are consistent if we run it a few times, they should be trustworthy. However, be careful if the feature importance varies greatly (see below), as that might indicate "
